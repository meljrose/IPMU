    "2. Does the occurence of AGN relate to the accretion rate of black holes or dark matter halos? \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by matching two photometric catalogs of galaxy RA & Dec locations with a spectroscopic catalog that informs us of the black hole accretion rate for each galaxy. This was done using the best match Sky algorithm in TOPCAT, with a tolerance of 1 arcsecond. The two photometric catalogs vary in dark matter halo accretion rate, so we compare the relation between BH accretion rate and DMH accretion rate between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then search for nearby galaxies with spectroscopic data within 10 Mpc of each galaxy in the catalogs. We add the number of satellite galaxies found into bins as a function of radius from the central galaxy. Each spectra is tagged as a Seyfert, Liner, Composite, etc., for each galaxy. We compare the type of galaxy surrounding each galaxy with the galaxy cluster's dark matter halo accretion rate. "
